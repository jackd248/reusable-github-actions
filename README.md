This repository provides useful GitHub Action workflows for use in my personal projects. It is not meant to be used anywhere else.

## üß© Workflows

## CGL

Comprehensive code quality workflow that validates composer dependencies, runs linting (PHP, composer.json, editorconfig), performs static code analysis and checks rector migrations.

```yaml
name: CGL
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
    cgl:
        uses: jackd248/reusable-github-actions/.github/workflows/cgl.yml@main
```

Input|Type| Required |Description
-|-|----------|-
`php-version`|input| false    |PHP version to use for the CGL check. Defaults to `8.3`.

## Tests

Matrix testing workflow that runs tests across multiple PHP and TYPO3 versions with both highest and lowest dependencies. Includes coverage reporting to CodeClimate and Coveralls.
